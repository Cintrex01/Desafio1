# Game Store

In this project, a website was created for a fictional video game store, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The website has 4 screens and uses javascript to validate form fields and store them in localStorage.

## HTML

The project was divided into 4 HTML files:

<ul>
  <li>home.html
    <ul>
      <li>It is the home screen, contains images and information about the games</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>contactUs.html
    <ul>
      <li>Contains the company's contact information and also a form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>sucess.html
    <ul>
      <li>When filling out the form correctly, this screen appears containing the data entered.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>error.html
    <ul>
      <li>If something doesn't work well then this screen is displayed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## CSS

<ul>
  <li>global.css</li>
  <li>header.css</li>
  <li>home.css</li>
  <li>trendingGames.css</li>
  <li>developments.css</li>
  <li>recentProjects.css</li>
  <li>subscribe.css</li>
  <li>footer.css</li>
  <li>contactUs.css</li>
  <li>form.css</li>
  <li>sucess.css</li>
  <li>error.css</li>
</ul>

Furthermore, to improve the user experience, hover effects were added when moving the mouse over the buttons.
